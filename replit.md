# [Project name]

_Replace the heading above with the project's name, and this line with one sentence describing what this app does for users._

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the API server (port 5000)
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- Build: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Where things live

_Populate as you build — short repo map plus pointers to the source-of-truth file for DB schema, API contracts, theme files, etc._

## Architecture decisions

- Voter identity anonymization: `votedUserIds` on a Poll never stores a raw Clerk/demo user ID. `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/voteHash.ts` HMAC-SHA256-hashes every voter ID (using the `VOTE_HASH_SALT` secret) right at the point it's persisted (queue.ts's batch flush) and right at the point it's checked (polls.ts's double-vote guard). This keeps the anti-cheat check 100% accurate while making the stored value non-reversible to a real identity.
- Double-voting on `/api/polls/:pollId/votes` returns **403** (not 409) — "Double-voting detected" — to reflect the hashed-identity check. The frontend (`poll-view.tsx`) treats 403 as "already voted" and shows the same friendly UX as a fresh vote.
- Guest/demo voters authenticate via a custom `X-Demo-User-Id` header (not `Authorization: Bearer`) so Clerk's own JWT parsing on that header is never triggered by a fake token. See `.agents/memory/clerk-guest-auth.md`.
